Topic + FEATURES - centauri-bash-lib - A versatile library to simplify Bash scripting
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

        Modern bash shells provide string handling, arrays and dictionaries. Also a large
        collection of bash-builtins exist. As a result scripts need to make little use
        of external tools like sed, grep or cat. For many little tools `centauri-bash-lib`
        will execute faster than a python script.

**Currently not yet released**

        - CGI support not yet finished
        - webapp in an early state
        - zenity support incomplete. Try kdialog

**Features**

        The `centauri-bash-lib` was written to simplify the creation of bash scripts that
        run fast and show GNU-coreutils-like command line behaviour. 

        - it is not a monster - happily runs even on a Raspberry Pi zero
        - not distribution dependent, also runs on android/termux
        - is self-contained, no tools except bash >= 4.1 and some GNU-coreutils are needed
        - no system-wide installation required, needs no installer tools
        - built-in documentation and a documentation system
        - built-in debug support and bash 'set -eE' and 'set -x' support
        - roughly 100 library functions
        - minimizing the use of external tools and sub-shells
        - the library is divided into modules
        - provides automatic module loading
        - has modules for: console, dialogs, batch, services, pipes, sort/grep, xml, CGI
        - supports some GUI dialogs via kdialog
        - supports some consoles like: konsole, gnome-terminal, xterm
        - supports systemd (and SysV) services including service file generation
        - will use extra bash built-ins: ln, mkdir, mkfifo, rmdir, unlink, sleep 
        - scripts can have GNU like options and arguments
        - scripts can have a --help feature
        - scripts can provide bash commandline completion
        - scripts can be localized
        - scripts have a built-in pager function (less or more)
        - a template based script creator
        - various templates including services and CGI
        - stand-alone scripts that can be distributed as a single file
